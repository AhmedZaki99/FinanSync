# 📈 FinanSync

FinanSync simplifies financial management by organizing your accounts in a notebook-like structure. As you make transactions between accounts, FinanSync keeps them in sync and tracks their history.


## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of FinanSync is to offer an accessible and collaborative environment for experimenting with a range of features, emerging technologies, and newly-acquired skills, prior to integrating them into fully-functional applications.

FinanSync will only be launched for production purposes once it has demonstrated its viability and effectiveness in the market.


## 🚀 Future

Later plans for the project include adding features to manage invoices for sales and purchases, as well as inventory management for retail businesses. These features will then be accompanied by a variety of reports and analytical tools.
